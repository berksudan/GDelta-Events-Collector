# Manuel for Building and Running

1. Build the virtualenv and the packages, by running the following command in terminal:
```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

2. Run the program, by running the following command in terminal:
```bash
$ ./run.sh
```

**Note:** If you are using Windows or Mac, you should manually create virtual environment and install the packages in ``requirements.txt``. Then you can run the program with ``python3 src/main.py`` command.
